# Brianna Bach - CS @ TAMU

## Background üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
I am a senior at Texas A&M University pursuing a B.A. in **Computer Science** with an expected graduation date of May 2026. 

Last summer, I worked as a **Software Development Engineer Intern** at **Amazon Web Services**, where I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, received valuable mentorship, and thrived in a fast-paced, real-world environment. I previously interned at the Federal Aviation Administration, where I worked on **AI/ML verification** to support system certification efforts.

I am passionate about building inventive solutions through code and excited to continue growing professionally.
